- The user must be able to create an account and log in.
- When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
- Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment
- User can filter expenses.
- User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
- You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
- Bonus: unit and e2e tests!
- You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
